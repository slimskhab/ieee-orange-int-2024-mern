# IEEE x Orange Summer Internship 2024 - MERN Stack Technical Test

Welcome to the technical test for the Orange IEEE x Orange Summer Internship 2024! This test is designed to assess your proficiency in building a full-stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). You have 4 hours to complete the tasks outlined below.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
- Familiarity with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js is essential.
- Basic understanding of RESTful API design and CRUD operations.
- Ability to implement basic authentication and authorization mechanisms is a plus.

## Tasks
1. **Backend Development (Node.js & Express.js)**
   - Set up a Node.js server using Express.js.
   - Implement a MongoDB database connection.
   - Design and implement RESTful API endpoints for the following operations:
     - Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for a resource (e.g., 'tasks', 'notes', 'users', etc.).
     - Ensure appropriate validation and error handling for API requests.
   - **Folder Structure:** Ensure backend code is organized in a `backend` folder.

2. **Frontend Development (React.js)**
   - Create a React.js application.
   - Implement components for:
     - Listing all items from the backend API.
     - Adding a new item.
     - Editing an existing item.
     - Deleting an item.
   - Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.
   - **Folder Structure:** Ensure frontend code is organized separately from backend in a `frontend` folder.

3. **Integration**
   - Integrate the frontend and backend to create a seamless MERN stack application.
   - Test the integration thoroughly to ensure data flow and functionality.

4. **Authentication (Bonus Task)**
   - Implement basic authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Secure the API endpoints to require authentication for certain operations (e.g., create, update, delete).

## Submission Guidelines
- Fork this repository.
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
- Create a new branch named `firstname-lastname`.
- Complete the tasks within 3 hours.
- Commit your changes frequently with clear commit messages.
- **.gitignore:** Include a `.gitignore` file in the `backend` folder to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
- **.env file:** Add a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with the MongoDB connection URL (`MONGODB_URI`).

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality:** Does the application meet the requirements specified?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, modular, and easy to understand?
- **UI/UX:** Is the user interface intuitive and responsive?
- **Error Handling:** Does the application handle errors gracefully?
- **Bonus Points:** For implementing authentication and authorization.

## Additional Information
- Feel free to use any additional libraries or frameworks you deem necessary.
- Use best practices for security and performance.
- **Academic Integrity:** Cheating or obtaining information from sources like chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) is strictly prohibited and will result in disqualification.
